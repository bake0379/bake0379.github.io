        <h2><u>About Me</u></h2>
        <img src="images/headshot2.jpg" alt="headshot" height="400" id="my-image">
        <p>My name is Troy Joseph Knox Baker.  I was named after my dad's father, Joseph Troy Baker. I was born abroad, in Paris, to a mother in the Canadian External Affairs, and a father in the American Air Force.We traveled around a bit, when I was very young.  But we settled in Southern California before my 4<sup>th</sup> birthday.  Here, Dad retired, and Mom got a job with the <abbr title="United States Army Corps of Engineers">USACE</abbr>, my brother was born, and we grew up into adulthood.</p>
        <p>Growing up with stories of my parent's travels and adventures, I'd always wanted to leave and explore new parts of the world myself.  On a vacation, my partner and I visited and fell in love with Portland, Oregon.  We moved there withing six months, and even after the relationship dissolved, I stayed for years.  Now I'm here in Ottawa, taking advantage of my barely-used Canadian citizenship.  I hope to see even <em>more</em> of the world as time keeps marching on.</p>
